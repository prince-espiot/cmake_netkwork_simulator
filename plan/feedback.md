# Project plan feedback
* Good plan, introduction and scope are clear and seem well thought out. Looking forward to your implementation!
* Program structure looks good, although more attention should be given to the Qt GUI implementation in the final
  documentation.
* Grouping into two subgroups seems a good idea, as the backend can be abstracted into the defined class structures and 
  the Qt front-end are used idiomatically to only handle the GUI.
* What tools are planned to be used to distribute and follow the progress on smaller work packages and tasks?
* Schedule looks in general achievable, but work packages could maybe be laid out in little bit more detail (regarding
  weeks 46-48).
